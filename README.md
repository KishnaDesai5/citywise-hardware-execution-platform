# Citywise Hardware Execution Platform  
### UI/UX Design for a High-Trust, City-Based Cluster & Marketplace System

---

## Overview
This project is a UI/UX design solution for a city-based **“Cluster + Marketplace” platform** that helps electronics hardware startups convert ideas into execution by assembling **trusted, execution-ready local teams**.

Unlike traditional marketplaces, this platform is designed for **high-stakes decisions**—where trust, accountability, and coordination matter more than quick checkout.

---

## Problem Context
Early-stage hardware startups often struggle to move from concept to execution because they face uncertainty around:

- What execution roles are required (PCB, embedded, mechanical, QA)
- Whether to hire individual freelancers or coordinated teams
- How to assess trust, quality, and accountability
- Realistic cost, timeline, and execution risk

This design focuses on reducing these uncertainties through **structured guidance and transparent decision-making**.

---

## Design Goals
- Guide users toward the **right engagement model** (Cluster vs Freelancer)
- Enable **city-based discovery** for faster coordination and execution
- Establish trust through verification, clarity, and assisted workflows
- Prevent false confidence in complex or high-risk scenarios

---

## Core UX Approach
- **Progressive commitment**: Users move from intent → city → recommendation → discovery → commitment
- **Decision-first design**: Engagement model recommendations appear before browsing options
- **Trust before pricing**: Capability fit and verification are prioritized over cost comparison
- **Human-in-the-loop fallback**: Complex requirements trigger assisted expert review instead of hard failure

---

## Key Deliverables
- Competitor study (3 relevant platforms)
- User journey and information architecture
- Low-fidelity wireframes demonstrating the full flow
- UX microcopy for guidance, trust, and edge cases
- Three key UX decisions with rationale
- Clear documentation of assumptions and AI usage

## Assumptions
- Users are hardware founders or product managers at early or growth stages
- City-based execution reduces coordination overhead and execution delays
- Trust, clarity, and accountability outweigh lowest-price decision-making

---

## AI Usage Disclosure
AI tools were used for research support and language refinement.  
All UX flows, information architecture, engagement logic, trust modeling, and design rationale are original work.
